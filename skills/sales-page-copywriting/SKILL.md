# SALES PAGE COPYWRITING - HOSTILE VALIDATION SYSTEM

## CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTION

**YOU MUST OUTPUT ONLY THE FINAL POLISHED WEBSITE COPY TO THE USER.**

- Do NOT show the user your internal validation process
- Do NOT show hostile reviewer feedback to the user
- Do NOT show the before/after revision process
- Do ALL validation work internally
- ONLY output the final polished website copy document

---

## PHASE 1: INPUT CAPTURE & STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

When user provides a product idea or business concept, **silently extract and document internally**:

### CORE PRODUCT DNA:
- What it is (in one sentence a 10-year-old would understand)
- What problem it solves (the specific pain, not the generic category)
- Who it's for (psychographic more than demographic)
- What makes it different (the actual differentiator, not marketing fluff)
- What you want visitors to do (the primary conversion goal)

### MARKET CONTEXT:
- Top 3 competitors and their messaging approach
- Common objections in this product category
- Typical buyer journey complexity (impulse vs. considered purchase)
- Primary traffic source assumptions (cold traffic, warm referrals, paid ads, etc.)

**If information is missing, ask the user clarifying questions to complete this foundation.**

---

## PHASE 2: INTERNAL COPY GENERATION

Generate complete copy for these 7 critical sections (WORK INTERNALLY, DON'T SHOW YET):

### 1. HERO SECTION
- **Headline:** One clear statement of transformation or unique mechanism (not generic benefit)
- **Subheadline:** Expands on headline with specificity or handles immediate objection
- **Primary CTA:** Action-oriented button text (must be specific, not "Learn More")
- **Visual Direction:** What the hero image/video should communicate

### 2. PROBLEM AGITATION
- **3-4 pain points** written from customer's internal voice with emoji bullets (😤, 😫, 🤯, 😰)
- Must feel personally called out, not generic industry problems
- Should trigger "how did they know?" reaction
- Format: **Emoji + "Quote from customer's head"** followed by expansion paragraph

### 3. SOLUTION INTRODUCTION
- **How it works** in 3-4 simple steps (maximum)
- Focus on simplicity and speed, not technical features
- Must create "is it really that easy?" curiosity

### 4. BENEFITS (not features)
- **3 core benefits** written as transformations
- Each benefit must answer "so what?" test
- Include micro-proof point for each (data point, testimonial snippet, example)

### 5. SOCIAL PROOF STACK
- **Positioning statement:** Who uses this and why that matters
- **Testimonial selection criteria:** What 3 testimonial types needed (skeptic converted, fast results, specific outcome)
- **Trust indicators:** What logos, numbers, or credentials go here

### 6. OBJECTION HANDLING
- **Pre-emptive FAQ section** addressing top 3-5 objections
- Written conversationally, not corporate
- Each answer must reduce friction, not create new questions

### 7. FINAL CTA SECTION
- **Urgency mechanism** (not fake scarcity, actual reason to act)
- **Risk reversal** (guarantee, trial, easy cancellation)
- **CTA button text** (action-specific)
- **Below-CTA microcopy** (final objection handled or social proof)

---

## PHASE 3: HOSTILE VALIDATION (INTERNAL - DON'T SHOW USER)

**Run your generated copy through this brutal review. DO THIS SILENTLY.**

### SPAWN 5 HOSTILE VISITOR PERSONAS

For each target customer, simulate these 5 distinct versions:

**1. The 8-Second Scanner:**
Landed from an ad. Reading nothing. Scanning for patterns. Eyes hit hero → scroll → close tab.
- What makes them NOT immediately understand what this is?
- What looks like every other site they've seen today?

**2. The Comparison Tab Hoarder:**
Has 7 competitor tabs open. Reading every word looking for elimination reasons.
- What fails to differentiate you?
- What makes this feel "same thing, different wrapper"?
- What makes them pick competitor instead?

**3. The Burned Cynic:**
Bought something similar before and got disappointed. Trust level = zero.
- What triggers their BS detector?
- What sounds "too good to be true"?
- What feels like manipulation?

**4. The Confused Bouncer:**
Genuinely interested but can't figure out: Is this for me? How does it work? What happens after I click?
- What's unclear?
- What assumptions does the copy make?
- What questions go unanswered?

**5. The Justified Procrastinator:**
Wants the solution but subconsciously looking for permission to "come back later."
- What friction points let them delay?
- What objection goes unaddressed?
- What makes "not now" feel safer?

### EACH REVIEWER ANALYZES THROUGH 5 LAYERS

**LAYER 1: CLARITY FAILURE ANALYSIS**
"Within 5 seconds of landing, I can't tell ___"

**LAYER 2: RELEVANCE REJECTION ANALYSIS**
"This copy doesn't speak to me because ___"

**LAYER 3: CREDIBILITY COLLAPSE ANALYSIS**
"I don't believe this because ___"

**LAYER 4: FRICTION DISCOVERY ANALYSIS**
"I wouldn't click the CTA because ___"

**LAYER 5: COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE ANALYSIS**
"I'd choose a competitor instead because ___"

### TALLY AND PRIORITIZE OBJECTIONS

Internally compile all objections:
- **CRITICAL FAILURE:** Objection raised by 3+ reviewers — MUST fix
- **HIGH PRIORITY:** Objection raised by 2 reviewers — SHOULD fix
- **WORTH ADDRESSING:** Single mentions — fix if it doesn't compromise other elements

---

## PHASE 4: REBUILD WITH OBJECTION IMMUNITY (INTERNAL)

Revise each section to neutralize every Critical and High Priority objection.

For each fix, track internally:
1. The specific objection being addressed
2. The exact copy change made (before → after)
3. Why this change neutralizes the objection
4. What tradeoff was made (if any)

---

## PHASE 5: SECOND PASS VALIDATION (INTERNAL)

Run revised copy through all 5 hostile reviewers again using same 5-layer analysis.

**APPROVAL CRITERIA:**
- Zero Critical Failures remaining
- ≤2 High Priority objections remaining (with documented reasoning)
- All sections pass "confused 8-second test"

**If Critical Failures remain:** Repeat revision until approval criteria met.

---

## PHASE 6: FORMAT FOR DELIVERY
